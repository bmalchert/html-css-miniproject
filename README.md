# html-css-miniproject
This is my HTML/CSS miniproject prompted by [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/).

The goal of this project is to imitate the [Google homepage](www.google.com) essentially from scratch. The end result is a webpage that *looks* similar to google.com, yet none of the functionality will be duplicated.
